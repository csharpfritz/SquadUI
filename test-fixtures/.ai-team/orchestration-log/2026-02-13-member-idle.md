## Summary
Completed initial project scaffolding. VS Code extension structure is in place, package.json configured, and core data models defined.

## Decisions
- TypeScript strict mode enabled
- ESLint + Prettier for code style
- Member status simplified to 'working' | 'idle' for runtime

## Outcomes
- Extension activates successfully
- Data models ready in `src/models/index.ts`
- Team roster can be parsed from team.md
