# Diagnosis: Empty Tree View Issue (#19)

**Author:** Basher (Tester)  
**Date:** 2026-02-13  
**Issue:** #19 — Debug empty tree view issue

## Problem Statement

The tree view shows no content when pointing the extension at `D:\blazorlora`, which has a `.ai-team/` folder with an EMPTY `.ai-team/orchestration-log/` folder.

## Data Flow Analysis

I traced the complete data flow from extension activation to tree rendering:

```
extension.ts
    └── SquadDataProvider(workspaceRoot)
            └── getSquadMembers()
                    └── getLogEntries()
                            └── OrchestrationLogService.parseAllLogs()
                                    └── discoverLogFiles() → returns []
                    └── getMemberStates() → returns empty Map
                    └── getActiveTasks() → returns []
            └── returns [] (empty member list)
    └── SquadTreeProvider.getSquadMemberItems()
            └── dataProvider.getSquadMembers() → []
            └── returns [] (empty tree)
```

## Root Cause

**The extension derives ALL squad members from orchestration log participants only.**

### Evidence from Code

**SquadDataProvider.getSquadMembers()** (lines 40-48):
```typescript
// Build member list from all participants across log entries
const members: SquadMember[] = [];
const memberNames = new Set<string>();

for (const entry of entries) {
    for (const participant of entry.participants) {
        memberNames.add(participant);
    }
}
```

When `entries` is empty (no orchestration logs exist), `memberNames` is empty, and the tree shows nothing.

**OrchestrationLogService.discoverLogFiles()** (lines 25-55):
- Only searches `.ai-team/orchestration-log/` and `.ai-team/log/`
- Returns `[]` if directories are empty or missing
- This is correct behavior for the service's scope

**OrchestrationLogService.getMemberStates()** (lines 139-165):
- Returns empty Map when no entries exist
- This is expected — no activity means no member states

## The Design Gap

The extension assumes orchestration logs are the primary source of truth for team membership. However:

1. **team.md** contains the canonical team roster with roles and status
2. **orchestration-log/** only records activity (who worked, when, on what)
3. A new project with a team.md but no logs shows NOTHING in the tree

## What SHOULD Happen

The tree view should show all members from `team.md`, even if they have no logged activity. Members with activity would show as "working" with tasks; members without activity would show as "idle" with no tasks.

## Recommended Fix

**Create a `TeamMdService` to read the team roster from `.ai-team/team.md`.**

### Implementation Approach

1. **New Service:** `src/services/TeamMdService.ts`
   - Parse the Members table from team.md
   - Extract: name, role, charter path, status (Active/Silent/Monitor)
   - Return structured `TeamMember[]` data

2. **Update SquadDataProvider.getSquadMembers():**
   - Get members from `TeamMdService` as primary source
   - Overlay activity status from `OrchestrationLogService.getMemberStates()`
   - Members in recent logs → status: "working"
   - Members not in recent logs → status: "idle"

3. **Fallback Behavior:**
   - If team.md missing: fall back to current log-participant behavior
   - If both missing: show helpful empty state message

### team.md Table Format (for parser)

```markdown
## Members

| Name | Role | Charter | Status |
|------|------|---------|--------|
| Danny | Lead | `.ai-team/agents/danny/charter.md` | ✅ Active |
```

Parser needs to:
- Find `## Members` section
- Parse markdown table rows
- Extract Name, Role columns
- Filter by Status (Active = show in tree)

## Test Cases to Add

1. **Empty orchestration-log with team.md** → shows team.md members as idle
2. **team.md missing, logs present** → falls back to log participants
3. **Both missing** → shows empty state message
4. **Mixed** → team.md members + activity status from logs

## Files to Modify

- `src/services/TeamMdService.ts` (new)
- `src/services/SquadDataProvider.ts` (integrate TeamMdService)
- `src/services/index.ts` (export new service)
- `test-fixtures/` (add team.md fixtures)
- `src/test/suite/services.test.ts` (add TeamMdService tests)

---

**For Linus:** This diagnosis identifies the exact code paths. The fix requires creating `TeamMdService` and integrating it as the primary member source in `SquadDataProvider`.
