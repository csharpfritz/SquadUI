### 2026-02-14: SquadDataProvider uses team.md as authoritative roster

**By:** Linus
**What:** `SquadDataProvider.getSquadMembers()` now reads team.md first via `TeamMdService`, then overlays orchestration log status on top. If team.md is missing, it falls back to the original log-participant discovery behavior.
**Why:** Without this, projects with a team.md but no orchestration logs showed an empty tree view (#19). The roster should always come from team.md — it's the canonical source of who's on the team. Orchestration logs only tell us *what they're doing*, not *who they are*. This separation of concerns makes the data layer more resilient and the UI more useful on first load.
