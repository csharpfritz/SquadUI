### 2026-02-13: MVP scope and phasing
**By:** Danny
**What:** 
- **v0 (MVP):** Tree view + webview UI, orchestration logs as data source, working/idle indicators
- **v1:** Add GitHub issues integration as second data source
- Tree structure: Squad members → Tasks → Work details
- Both data sources will eventually be unified under a common task model

**Why:** Phasing reduces initial complexity. Orchestration logs are immediate; GitHub issues can be layered on once the UI is validated.
