# Session: v0.2.0 Kickoff

**Date:** 2026-02-13  
**Requested by:** Jeffrey T. Fritz

## Participants

- **Livingston** (DevOps/CI) — joined team
- **Basher** (Tester/QA)
- **Linus** (Core Services)
- **Danny** (Lead/Orchestration)

## Work Completed

### 1. Livingston — DevOps/CI Onboarding
- Established CI pipeline configuration (Node 18.x, lint → compile → test)
- Pipeline registered at `.github/workflows/ci.yml`
- Assigned to issue #22

### 2. Basher — Empty Tree View Diagnosis
- Diagnosed issue #19: tree view shows no content when orchestration-log is empty
- Root cause: extension derives members from logs only, ignores team.md
- Recommended fix: create TeamMdService to read team.md as primary source
- Detailed diagnosis document created for Linus

### 3. Linus — TeamMdService Implementation
- Designed team.md parser service
- Defined interfaces: ExtendedTeamRoster, CopilotCapabilities
- Decisions: status badge mapping, copilot auto-assign detection, dual format support
- Implementation: src/services/TeamMdService.ts
- Assigned to issue #21
- PR #28 opened

### 4. Danny — v0.3.0 Planning
- Designed squad management features: init, add/remove members, universe selector
- Created detailed architecture plan with code examples
- Acceptance criteria and open questions documented
- Phasing strategy: v0 (MVP) → v1 (GitHub issues integration)
- Related issues: #24–#27

## Decisions Made

1. **CI Configuration:** Node 18.x LTS, npm ci → lint → compile → test pipeline
2. **Data Models:** SquadMember, Task, WorkDetails, OrchestrationLogEntry, TeamRoster
3. **Team.md Parser:** HTML comment for copilot-auto-assign, dual format support, skip Coordinators
4. **Extension Structure:** Lazy activation on squadMembers view, single squadui container
5. **v0.3.0 Features:** Squad init, member management, universe selector, command palette integration

## Key Outcomes
