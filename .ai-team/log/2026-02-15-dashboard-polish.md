# Session: 2026-02-15 Dashboard Polish

**Requested by:** Jeffrey T. Fritz

## Participants
- Rusty (Extension Dev)

## Work Summary

Rusty completed dashboard improvements:
- Fixed velocity chart visibility on dark themes (CSS variable resolution in Canvas 2D context)
- Added Y-axis labels (0, midpoint, max) and X-axis date labels (MM/DD format)
- Fixed decisions panel empty state (renderDecisions hoisting issue, added empty state message)
- Improved chart grid lines at 30% opacity for readability

## Directives Captured

- **Release Gate:** User directive (Jeffrey T. Fritz) — Never release without explicit human approval. All releases must be approved by a human team member before tagging or publishing.

## Decisions Recorded
1. Release approval directive (via Copilot)
2. v0.6.0 Sprint Plan (Danny)
3. Dashboard Chart & Decisions Rendering Fixes (Rusty)

## Outcome

Dashboard now has readable charts and proper decision display. Session inputs merged into team decisions log.
