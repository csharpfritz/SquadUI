# Session: 2026-02-14 — Brainstorming

**Requested by:** Jeffrey T. Fritz

## Who Worked

- **Danny** (PM) — Visibility/management features from PM perspective
- **Rusty** (UI/Ext Dev) — UI/UX proposals for VS Code integration

## What They Did

Brainstormed feature proposals to enhance SquadUI visibility and management capabilities for project managers. Focused on converting raw team data (orchestration logs, decisions, ceremonies) into actionable insights and dashboards.

## Key Outcomes

Generated 10 feature proposals across two perspectives:

**PM-Focused Features (Danny):**
1. Velocity Dashboard — rolling metrics (7d/14d/30d), burn-up charts
2. Team Health Heatmap — workload distribution, collaboration patterns
3. Decision Browser — searchable decision history with filtering
4. Ceremony Timeline — retrospective outcomes, action item tracking
5. Blocker & Dependency Visualizer — task dependency graph

**UI/Extension Features (Rusty):**
1. Activity Timeline Visualization — interactive D3.js timeline with swimlanes
2. Real-Time Status Bar Integration — live squad status, alerts
3. Tree Item Badge Decorations — task counts, blocked indicators
4. Member Performance Dashboard — velocity, completion metrics, charts
5. Skill Coverage Matrix — heatmap of member skills vs. catalog

## Next Steps

- Prioritize 1-2 features for next milestone
- Design webview layouts (MVP with text/CSS, no heavy dependencies)
- Assign development ownership
