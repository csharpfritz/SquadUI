# Project Context

- **Owner:** Jeffrey T. Fritz (csharpfritz@users.noreply.github.com)
- **Project:** VS Code extension for visualizing Squad team members and their tasks
- **Stack:** TypeScript, VS Code Extension API, potentially GitHub Copilot integration
- **Created:** 2026-02-13

## Learnings Summary

### v0.1v0.2: Core Data Pipeline Foundation
- OrchestrationLogService, TeamMdService, SquadDataProvider, FileWatcherService, GitHubIssuesService with test fixtures
- Two-tier member resolution: team.md + log overlay
- Dual-directory log discovery (orchestration-log/ + log/)
- Multi-format participant extraction (inline, table, agent-routed fields)
- Prose + issue-based task extraction with deterministic task IDs ({date}-{agent-slug})
- Flexible GitHub issue matching: labels, assignees, any-label strategies

### GitHubIssuesService Architecture
- IGitHubIssuesService interface enables graceful degradation and late binding
- Issues use $(issues) codicon with theme color tinting (green open, purple closed)
- Squad labels filtered from display to avoid redundancy
- Default matching strategy: ['labels', 'assignees'] when no config present
- Member Aliases table parsed from team.md Issue Source section
- Separate closedCache for closed issues; fetch max 50, sorted by updated_at descending

### SkillCatalogService & Log Parsing
- Fetches from awesome-copilot + skills.sh using Node's https module
- All methods swallow network errors and return empty arrays (graceful degradation)
- Deduplicates toward awesome-copilot version
- No npm dependencies

### Log Summary Extraction Priority Chain
1. ## Summary section
2. | **Outcome** | value | table field
3. Heading title after em dash
4. First prose paragraph (prevents table markdown leakage)

### OrchestrationLogService Features
- Filename regex handles both YYYY-MM-DD-topic.md and YYYY-MM-DDThhmm-topic.md formats
- Agent Routed table field fallback: | **Agent routed** | Fury (Lead) |  extracts agent name, strips role suffix and pipes
- Who Worked table format parsing: xtractTableFirstColumn() helper
- Prose task extraction: "What Was Done" section highest priority, synthetic fallback per entry
